🎯 1. Start by Thinking Backward: What Might the Business Need?
Business Goals:

Improve customer experience

Reduce churn rate

Optimize product performance

Increase operational efficiency

Possible Questions the Business May Ask:

What are the most common customer complaints?

Which products are underperforming?

How can we predict which customers might leave?

Where can we reduce cost without affecting quality?

🧠 2. Gather Requirements (How I Would Approach It)
Step 1: Stakeholder Interviews

Meet with marketing, sales, operations, and product teams.

Ask questions like:

“What reports do you rely on today?”

“Where do you spend the most time making decisions?”

“What decisions are hard to make right now?”

Step 2: Review Existing Dashboards or Reports

Identify gaps in current data.

Look for redundant or manual processes.

Step 3: Understand Data Sources

CRM tools (e.g., Salesforce)

Web analytics (e.g., Google Analytics)

Product databases

Excel/CSV reports from departments

Step 4: Define KPIs and Metrics

Customer Lifetime Value

Conversion Rate

Average Response Time

Return on Investment (ROI)

🗺️ 3. My Next Steps After Gathering Requirements
Document all requirements in a central place (Notion, Google Docs, etc.)

Build a data model or sketch a data pipeline plan.

Prioritize the high-impact use cases.

Start creating ETL workflows, dashboards, or data visualizations.
